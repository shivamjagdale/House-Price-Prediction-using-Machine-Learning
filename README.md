# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Here we are going to predict the house prices using Machine Learning

Here we have several data points to help us with that such as Crime-rate, Taxes, NOX (amount of Nitrogen Oxide concentration etc.)

For this prediction we will be using XGBoost Regression Algorithm. Here we are predicting continuous values so we use XGBoost Regression. 
Here for price we want to predict continuous values i.e house price. This is not some type of classification but we want an actual number. 

XGBoost Regression is a type of decision tree algorithm. If we want to be more precise this is decision tree based ensemble model. 
Ensemble meaning we use more than one model. It is like incorporating 2 or more models together.
